;;; init-windows.el --- Working with windows within frames -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;;; Commentary:

;; This is not about the "Windows" OS, but rather Emacs's "windows"
;; concept: these are the panels within an Emacs frame which contain
;; buffers.

;;; Code:

;; Navigate window layouts with "C-c <left>" and "C-c <right>"

(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'winner-mode)

;; Make "C-x o" prompt for a target window when there are more than 2
